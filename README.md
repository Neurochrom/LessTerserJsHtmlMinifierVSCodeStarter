# Less Terser Js HTML-minifier VS Code Starter

This is a HTML project configures to be developed within Visual Studio code, minified (built) on save with all source maps properly configured as to allow visual studio & chrome debugging.

## Prerequisites

Install Visual Studio Code and the following  plugins:

- Easy LESS
- Save and Run
- Debugger for Chrome

Install Node and npm and additional packages by issuing the following command:

```
npm install -g terser less html-minifier
```

## Have fun

To generate the build just save the .html and .less and at least one .js file with VS Code.
The output will be in the builds directory.
When you start debugging Chrome will create a new profile - this makes it not work for the first time sometimes.
